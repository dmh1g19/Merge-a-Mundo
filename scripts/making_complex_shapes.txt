# Worflow for making complex shapes

## First

Create the bounding area in ```physicsEditor```

## Second

Export the coordinates and create a groundBinding vector (look at shapeFactory for examples)

## Third

Use python script to triangulate polygons generated for making the bounding box and use those vertices for openGL

WARNING

Translating complex shapes works fine, as well as any other operations except scaling!

I haven't sorted scaling out yet, for the mean time it takes x=0, y=0 and used the default vertices for placement,
when generating the bounding box make sure it's generates in a window with the same window size initially.
